# Comprehensive Sales Analytics with PostgreSQL & Power BI

## Introduction
This project presents an **end-to-end sales analytics solution** for an online retail dataset.  
It covers the entire process: from **data modeling in PostgreSQL** to building an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that delivers actionable insights for decision-making.

## ETL & Data Modeling Process

### 1. Data Extraction & Loading
- Raw data (Excel/CSV) was imported into a PostgreSQL database.  
- This approach ensures efficient handling of large and complex datasets.  

### 2. Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Duplicate and null values were removed.  
- A **Star Schema** was created with Fact and Dimension tables for scalable reporting.  
- All transformations were performed using **SQL scripts**.  

### 3. Data Visualization
- Cleaned and modeled tables were connected to Power BI.  
- Built KPIs, charts, and advanced features such as:  
  - **Drill-through analysis**  
  - **Key Influencers visual**  
  - **Interactive slicers**
